# repl.s — REPL Command Interface

**Template:** [module](../templates/module.md)

REPL command interpreter and screen output.  Hex parsing helpers
(`_hex_val`, `_is_hex`, `_hex_val_to_char`) are local to repl.s.

## Interface

- `exec_line()` — parse current screen line, dispatch command
- `read_line()` — capture screen row at io_cy into line_buf (PETSCII)
- `show_prompt()` — write `AAAA:` at cursor using cur_addr

**State:**
- `cur_addr` (uint16) — current address, default $1000
- `cur_device` (uint8) — disk device number, default 8
- `cur_filename` (char[]) — last used filename
- `last_cmd` (char) — last command (for RETURN repeat)
- `block_size` (uint16) — block size for m/d/f/>/+/-, default $10

**Logging API** (used by other modules for consistent output):
- `out_log(Y=level, A/X=content)` — complete log line
- `out_log_open(Y=level)` / `out_close()` — open/close for multi-part output
- `out_err(A/X)` / `out_warn(A/X)` / `out_info(A/X)` — level shortcuts

Three levels: `LOG_ERR='?'` → `";?"`, `LOG_WARN='!'` → `";!"`,
`LOG_INFO=' '` → `"; "`.

**Depends on:** asm_line (`.`), asm_src (`a`), dasm (`d`), expr (`?`),
disk (`l`/`s`/`$`), debugger (`b`/`c`/`t`/`o`), editor, screen, cse_io,
strings

## Design

### Prompting loop

The main loop owns the prompt.  Command handlers never write it.

1. Assume the cursor is on the line where the prompt is to appear.
2. Write `AAAA:` at column 0, where `AAAA` is `cur_addr`.
3. Leave the cursor at column 5 for user input.
4. Dispatch keystrokes to the keystroke handler; wait for RETURN.
5. `read_line` — capture the screen row into `line_buf`.
6. If the line begins with `AAAA:`, write `AAAA` to `cur_addr` and
   consume five characters from the line.
7. Seek to the first non-whitespace character; mark its column as
   *start*.  Seek to the first `;` or end-of-line; mark that column
   as *end*.
8. If *start* = *end* and column 6 holds `;`: advance to the next
   line, clear it, go to 1.
9. If *start* = *end* (empty, no `;`): dispatch command repetition
   (`last_cmd`), go to 1.
10. Otherwise dispatch the line from *start* to *end* to the command
    parser.
11. Go to 1.

`show_prompt` writes `AAAA:` and positions the cursor — nothing
else.  Whether the prompt line is cleared before `show_prompt`
runs is the responsibility of the previous command handler
(principle 5).

### Command handler principles

1. **The screen is the command buffer.**  Every screen line is
   executable.  The parser reads from column 0 to `;` or end-of-line.
   The screen operates in lowercase mode (VICII charset 2).

2. **Commands are case-sensitive single characters.**  `a`–`z` and
   `A`–`Z` are distinct command keys — 52 letter slots available.
   Lowercase is the default; uppercase requires SHIFT.  `read_line`
   maps lowercase screen codes ($01–$1A) to PETSCII $41–$5A and
   uppercase screen codes ($41–$5A) to PETSCII $C1–$DA.

3. **Commands own their output lines.**  Every line a handler writes
   must be `clear_eol`'d — no leftover characters from previous
   content.

4. **Commands own their prompt line.**  In block-edit mode (`.` with
   args, `m` with hex bytes), the handler rewrites its prompt line to
   reflect the edited state.  What's on screen is the truth.

5. **Commands own the next line's clearing.**  Before returning,
   handlers clear the prompt line (`clear_eol`) so the loop's
   `show_prompt` writes `AAAA:` onto a clean line.  Exception: `.`
   and `m` in edit mode leave the next line intact — this is the
   block-edit workflow (cursor up, modify, re-RETURN).  `show_prompt`
   itself never clears.

6. **Non-executable output starts with `;`.**  Info text, status
   lines, and error messages are prefaced with `;` so they're inert
   if the user hits RETURN on them.

7. **Executable output without a `cur_addr` relation omits `AAAA:`.**
   If an output line is meant to be re-executable but doesn't
   correspond to a sequential address, it has no address prefix.

8. **Auto-advance and repeat.**  Block-paging commands (`.`, `m`, `d`)
   update `cur_addr` to the continuation address.  RETURN on an empty
   prompt repeats `last_cmd` at the new `cur_addr`, always without
   args (dump/disassemble mode).  This supports paging:
   `d`‹RETURN›‹RETURN›‹RETURN› to scroll through disassembly, or
   `.`‹RETURN›‹RETURN› to step one instruction at a time.
   `last_cmd` stores only the command character — no args buffer.

9. **Block commands are thin loops over single-line emitters.**  `d`
   calls `emit_dot` repeatedly; `m` (dump) calls `emit_mem`
   repeatedly.  The emitter is the unit of work.

10. **`;` is a no-op command.**  Screen output accumulates as a
    readable, scrollable log.

### Error reporting

Errors use the prefix `;?` — the `;` makes the line non-executable
(principle 5), the `?` signals an error.  Examples:

    ;?asm           assembly error
    ;?cmd           unknown command
    ;?name          missing filename
    ;?range         invalid address range

The `?` expression calculator is not confused by this because `;`
terminates parsing before `?` is reached.

### Block-edit workflow

The block-edit workflow is how the user inspects and modifies code or
data in bulk.  It has two phases: **dump** and **edit**.

**Dump phase** — `d` and `m` (without args) are block commands.  They
operate on `block_size` bytes and output a screenful of executable
lines:

- `d` outputs `AAAA:. HH HH HH  MNE OPR` lines (via `emit_dot`)
- `m` outputs `AAAA:m HH HH ... cccccccc` lines (via `emit_mem`)

Each output line is a valid command.  The block command clears the
final prompt line and stops.  The screen is now a buffer of editable
commands.

**Edit phase** — the user cursors to any line on screen:

- Modify hex bytes in an `m` line, press RETURN → `m` re-executes
  with the edited bytes, rewrites the line to reflect the new memory
  state, advances `cur_addr`.
- Modify the mnemonic or operand in a `.` line, press RETURN → `.`
  re-assembles, rewrites the line with the new disassembly, advances.

When `.` or `m` are called **with arguments** (the user edited a
dump line and pressed RETURN), they enter block-edit mode:
1. Execute the edit (assemble instruction / write bytes)
2. Rewrite their own prompt line to reflect the new state (principle 3)
3. Do **not** clear the next line (principle 5 exception)
4. Advance `cur_addr` to the continuation address (principle 8)

The handler returns.  The prompting loop writes `AAAA:` over the
first five columns of the trailing line (updating the address
prefix) without clearing the rest — the existing dump content
from column 5 onward remains intact and editable.

Without arguments, these same commands are in dump mode (`.` disassembles
one line; `m` dumps `block_size` bytes) and clear the prompt line
normally.

The user can continue editing the next line or cursor back to edit
another line.  This creates a fluid cycle: dump → edit → re-execute
→ advance, all without leaving the screen.

### The `.` command in detail

The `.` handler has three modes:

1. **With hex byte args that differ from memory:** write the bytes to
   memory at `cur_addr`.
2. **With hex byte args that match memory:** pass the remaining text
   (mnemonic + operand) to the line assembler.
3. **Without args:** disassemble one instruction at `cur_addr`.

**Expression support:** In mode 2, the operand is evaluated through
`_expr_eval` before being passed to the line assembler.  This means
full expressions work in the `.` command:

    1000:. lda screen+$20     ; label + arithmetic
    1000:. sta <addr           ; lo byte operator
    1000:. ldx #cols-1         ; constant expression

Symbols and labels from the last source assembly (`a` command) are
available, since the symbol table heap persists between assemblies.

The operand is evaluated to a numeric value, formatted as `$XX` or
`$XXXX` (based on `expr_wide`), and the prefix/suffix characters
(`#`, `(`, `,x`, `)`, etc.) are preserved around it.  The formatted
string is then passed to `_asm_line` which handles only hex operands.

In all three cases, the handler finishes by disassembling the
instruction at `cur_addr` and rewriting the prompt line with the
result.  What's on screen always reflects the actual memory state.

### Line format and address handling

`AAAA:cmd [args]` or bare `cmd [args]`.  `;` terminates parsing
(inline comment).

If the line begins with `AAAA:`, the parser sets `cur_addr` to AAAA
before dispatching the command.  Commands operate on `cur_addr`, which
they may override with an optional address argument of their own.
After execution, commands update `cur_addr` to point past all the
bytes they consumed.

### Line editor rules

The REPL's line editor operates within the 40-column screen:

1. **Cursor movement stays within the screen.**  Left/right/up/down
   move within the visible 40×25 area.  No wrapping between lines,
   no scrolling.
2. **Character insertion fills up to column 38.**  Column 39 is
   reserved for the cursor.  Overflow shifts characters out at the
   right edge.
3. **DEL (backspace) left-deletes.**  Content right of the cursor
   shifts left; a space shifts in from the right edge.  Stops at
   start of line.  If column 5 contains `:` (a clean prompt line),
   stops at column 6 to protect the `AAAA:` prefix.  Cursor
   movement can still position past the `:` for on-screen edits.
4. **INS right-shifts.**  Content at and right of the cursor shifts
   right; a space opens at the cursor.  Overflow at column 38 is
   lost.

### Line formats (40 columns)

    AAAA:. HH HH HH  MNEMONIC OPERAND     asm / disasm
    AAAA:m HH HH HH HH HH HH HH HH cccc hex dump / edit
    r pc:XXXX a:XX x:XX y:XX s:XX Nv-bDizc CPU registers (UC=set)

### Unsaved-changes guard

The `k` (kill), `l` (load SEQ), and `Q` (quit) commands either destroy
the current source buffer or exit the program.  If the editor's dirty
flag is set (buffer modified since last save/load), these commands
prompt:

    ;unsaved. y/n?

The user must press `y` to proceed.  Any other key cancels.
PRG loads (`l` without `,s` suffix) do not trigger the guard because
they don't touch the source buffer.

The dirty flag is maintained by editor.s: set on any insert/delete,
cleared on save (`ed_save_source`) and load (`ed_load_source`).
Exported as `ed_dirty` for repl.s to read.

### Internal helpers

**`confirm_yn`** — shows the cursor (`cursor_show`), waits for a
keypress (`io_getc`), hides the cursor (`cursor_hide`).  Returns
Z=1 if the key was `y`.  Used by `check_unsaved`, `k` (kill), and
`Q` (quit) prompts.

**`run_user`** — wraps `dbg_enter` for all commands that execute
user code (`j`, `g`, `t`, `o`, `c`).  Saves `CUR_ROW`/`CUR_COL`
on the stack before entry and restores them after return.  Also
restores the VIC charset register (`$D018 |= $02`) and calls
`io_sync` to resync KERNAL screen line pointers.  Prevents screen
corruption caused by user code modifying cursor state or VIC
registers.

**`warn_long_lines`** — scans the buffer via `ed_read_byte`,
computing visual width per line (including tab expansion).
Prints `;!long LNN` for each line exceeding 39 visual columns.
Called after successful SEQ load and after successful SEQ save.

Several local helpers factor out repeated compound operations
(expression evaluation with address copy, block-size defaults,
breakpoint log formatting, color display).  The `u` (cpu) command
uses a table-driven dispatch instead of cascaded comparisons.
See `doc/optimization.md` strategies 22–23 for rationale.

### Splash screen

Displayed at startup by main.s.  Three memory summary lines show
hex address ranges and decimal free byte counts:

      zp 0002-007f      126 free
     sys 0200-03ff      512 free
    work XXXX-cfff    NNNNN free

All values are computed from linker symbols (`cse_end`) and the
`BUF_END` constant.  The work line's start address and byte count
update automatically as the binary grows.

### `B` — Block size (uppercase)

The `B` command sets a 16-bit block size used by `m`, `d`, `f`, `>`,
`/`, `t`, `o`, and `+`/`-` navigation.  Default: `$0010` (16 bytes
= 2 hex dump lines).

    B 40     set to 64 bytes (8 hex lines)
    B C0     set to 192 bytes (full screen of hex)
    B 0100   set to 256 bytes (4-digit)
    B        show current block size

### `$` — Disk

The `$` command is a unified interface for disk directory, drive
selection, and drive commands.  Parsing is prefix-based:

    $              directory listing (current drive)
    $9             select drive 9 as current, show directory

A single digit after `$` (8 or 9) sets `cur_device` permanently.
Bare `$` lists the directory.

### Tab width (build-time constant)

CSE's tab width is a **build-time constant** (`-DTAB_WIDTH=N`,
default 8).  It is not runtime-mutable — there is no `T` command.

Rationale: baking it in saves ~30 bytes (eliminates the runtime
`col_mod_tw` loop and the `T` command) and matches the C64-era
convention (Turbo Assembler, MasterSeka, Relaunch64 all default
to 8).

The "4-space" convention from modern high-level languages
doesn't fit 6502 assembly on a 40-column screen anyway — use 8.
If you really need a different value, rebuild with
`make TAB_WIDTH=N`.

### Loading files with long lines

`ed_load_source` loads file content verbatim — no line splitting
or width enforcement.  After load (and after save), the REPL
scans the buffer and prints one `;!long LNN` warning per line
exceeding 39 visual columns.  Lines show `>` in col 39 in the
editor.  Save writes the buffer verbatim, preserving the
original file structure.

### `i` — Memory map

Shows the full C64 memory layout.  Free regions are highlighted
(inverse address range).  All addresses are computed at build time
or runtime — nothing hardcoded.

     cpu 0000-0001      2  i/o port
      zp 0002-007f    126  free            ← highlighted
     sys 0080-00ff    128  kernal zp
     stk 0100-01ff    256  6502 stack
     sys 0200-02a6    167  kernal
    lo02 02a7-02ff     89  free            ← highlighted
     sys 0300-0333     52  kernal
    lo03 0334-03ff    204  free            ← highlighted
     scr 0400-07ff   1024  screen + sprites
    work 0800-XXXX  NNNNN  free            ← highlighted
     src XXXX-XXXX    NNN  N lines         (if source loaded)
     cse XXXX-CFFF  NNNNN  cse runtime     (from linker)
      io d000-dfff   4096  vic/sid/cia
     sym e000-eeff   3840  symbols
     cse ef00-f8d9   2522  banked
     rom f8da-ffff   1830  kernal rom

The lo02/lo03 rows match the splash screen layout — these are
the usable fragments in pages 2 and 3 between KERNAL work areas
and page-3 vectors.  The work row spans $0800 to `buf_base - 1`.
When source is loaded, the free region shrinks and the src row
appears.  The src line count comes from `ed_total_lines`.  The
KERNAL RAM region ($E000–$FFFF) is broken into three rows: `sym`
for the symbol table and heap, `cse` for banked data (stack
snapshots, KDATA tables, REPL screen save), and `rom` for actual
KERNAL ROM.

### `C` — Color (uppercase)

Accepts 1, 2, or 3 single hex digits.  Extra characters ignored.

    C 6          set text color to blue
    C 06         set bg=black, text=blue
    C 0e6        set border=black, bg=dark grey, text=blue

### `u` — CPU mode

    u 6502       standard NMOS 6502
    u 6510       6510 (with illegal opcodes)
    u 65c02      WDC 65C02 (CMOS extensions)

### Free / reserved keys

    e   reserved — editor mode (source buffer)
    h   free (was hunt, now `/`)
    n   free (was next/step-over, now `o`)
    p   reserved — print / evaluate
    v   reserved — visual mode (split screen?)
    w   free (was write/save, now `s`)
    x   free (was breakpoints, now `b`)
    y   free
    z   free

### Emitters

Single-line output functions, called by both edit-mode and block-mode
paths:

- `emit_dot(addr)` — writes `AAAA:. HH HH HH  MNE OPR`, returns
  instruction length.  Two spaces between hex bytes and mnemonic.
- `emit_mem(addr, cols)` — writes `AAAA:m HH HH HH HH HH HH HH HH cccc`
- `emit_reg()` — writes `r pc:xxxx a:xx x:xx y:xx s:xx Nv-bDizc`
  (set flags uppercase, clear flags lowercase; AND #$DF on PETSCII)

Each emitter starts at column 0 and calls `clear_eol` at the end.

## Caveats

- `read_line` reads screen RAM at the cursor row, converting screen
  codes to PETSCII.  Lowercase screen codes ($01–$1A) map to $41–$5A;
  uppercase screen codes ($41–$5A) map to $C1–$DA.  This preserves
  case for command dispatch.
- `exec_line` modifies `cur_addr` as a side effect of the `AAAA:` prefix.
- The `?` command uses `expr_eval` directly — labels from the last
  assembly are available.  Decimal output delegates to `io_putdec`
  (cse_io.s) with space-padding for right-aligned 5-digit display.
- **Expression arguments:** Commands `@`, `j`, `+`, `-`, `b`, `s`,
  `t`, `o`, `B` accept full expressions (`$hex`, decimal, symbols,
  operators).  Bare digits are decimal — hex requires `$` prefix.
  The `AAAA:` prompt prefix remains plain hex.
- File type (PRG vs SEQ) detected by `,s` suffix in filename.
