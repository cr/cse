# CSE — TODO

## Bugs

Open bugs, roughly ordered by priority.

- [x] NMI trampoline corrupted $01 by banking KERNAL in without
  restore.  Fixed: trampoline no longer modifies $01 (the NMI
  handler chain runs entirely in main RAM, no KERNAL ROM needed).
  Added defensive IRQ/BRK trampoline at $FF04 for the case where
  BRK fires with KERNAL unmapped.
- [ ] `.const FOO 1234` then `sta FOO` doesn't find the symbol.
  `sta foo` works.  Uppercase `.const` names not found by
  uppercase lookup, only by lowercase.  Assembler normalises
  to lowercase internally; symbol lookup should match.
- [ ] `l` command hang: loading a non-existing file may hang.
  Not yet reproducible.  Suspect: `disk_load_prg` or
  `ed_load_source` not handling KERNAL file-not-found error,
  or floppy status channel read blocking.
- [ ] INS in REPL: overwrites char under cursor with space and
  replaces char to the right with the adjacent character.
  Should shift row right and insert a space at cursor.
- [ ] `?` (calculator) wrong decimal output for values >= $2000.
  `? 2000` shows `2111` instead of `8192`.  `? 1999` is correct.
  Needs test coverage for io_putdec across the full 16-bit range.
- [ ] `a` save line writes filename "oup" — truncates the base
  name and overwrites its last char.  Should append `,p` to the
  full filename, not overwrite.
- [ ] `l "out,p" $2000` doesn't load to $2000.  PRG load with
  explicit address should honour the address argument, including
  the 2-byte load-address header.
- [ ] RUN/STOP debounce: bounces when held.  Primary mode-switch
  key feels broken.
- [ ] `.` (disassembly) shows CSE ZP instead of user ZP after
  j/debugger context.  Companion to the `m` fix in `ac1a31f`.
  `m` redirects reads in $02..$59 through `user_zp_buf` when
  `dbg_reason != 0`, but `.` still reads live memory.  Cheaper
  fix: unconditionally stage 3 bytes from `user_zp_buf` into
  `dbg_zp_view` before calling `dasm_insn` (~15 B code).  Low
  priority — users rarely disassemble at ZP.
- [ ] Debugger: stepping into a subroutine then `c` (continue)
  cannot return through the original JSR's pushed return address.
  The `sp_baseline` RTS trick unwinds the stack, so the
  subroutine's RTS pops the @tramp return instead of the original
  caller.  Fix: 256 B user-stack snapshot at `$EF00` under
  KERNAL (copy page 1 on debug entry/exit).  Acceptable
  trade-off for now.
- [ ] Debugger: `t1` traces over conditional branches (BNE etc.)
  instead of tracing into them.  The BRK-based step logic computes
  both branch target and fall-through, arms BRK at both, but the
  branch is not taken at runtime.  Likely cause: `reg_p` flags not
  correctly captured/restored across BRK, or the BRK at the branch
  target clobbers the instruction before it can execute.  Needs a
  test case: step through a tight DEX/BNE loop and verify PC follows
  the branch.
- [ ] Debugger: stepping `t1` over a JSR to KERNAL ROM ($E000+)
  silently falls back to step-over.  Consider showing a one-line
  note (e.g. `; rom step -> over`).  Low priority.

</details>

## Phase 9 — Test harness rewrite

`C64Emu` emulator class + production PRG replaces per-test build
systems, ASM stubs, and test-specific linker configs.

### Done

- [x] `tests/c64emu.py` — C64Emu class: py65 + KERNAL ROM overlay,
  $01 bank switching, screen RAM, jsr(), sym(), keyboard injection.
- [x] `tests/test_c64emu.py` — 34 smoke tests.
- [x] `tests/test_editor_asm.py` — 10 ASM-level editor tests
  (gap buffer, ed_new, dirty flag, ed_read_line).
- [x] `tests/test_screen_asm.py` — 15 ASM-level screen tests
  (scroll_up, newline, restore_colors, reset_screen, cursor toggle).
- [x] `tests/test_step_rom.py` — 8 debugger step-into ROM tests
  (replaced xfailed tests).
- [x] Makefile: `-Ln` label file, `check-roms` gate, `cse_prg` fixture.
- [x] KERNAL ROM setup: screen line link table ($D9-$F1), HIBASE,
  page-3 vectors via RESTOR.
- [x] `c64emu.py` load/run segment relocation: auto-copies segments
  with load ≠ run addresses (mirrors loader.s).

### Open

- [ ] Review l/s command tests (TestSaveCommand, TestLoadCommand):
  simplify the framework.  The stub BSS offset computation
  (hardcoded `+185`/`+187`/`+189`) is fragile — consider
  exporting witnesses via a cross-module import trick or
  reading from the RODATA sym_refs table like kplot_stub.
- [ ] Use debug builds and `od65 --dump-all foo.o` for extracting
  all symbols (exported and unexported) from object files for
  testing.  Use stripped production builds only for superficial
  end-to-end integration tests.  This eliminates fragile BSS
  offset computation and map-file parsing in test harnesses.
- [ ] Migrate remaining test files to C64Emu + full PRG.  Each old
  test file (test_repl, test_cse_io, test_expr, test_symtab,
  test_debugger, test_au_mode, test_mnhash, test_asm_line,
  test_dasm, test_asm_src) has its own build system, map parser,
  and run loop.  Migration removes ~1200 lines of harness code,
  9 ASM stub files, and 3 linker configs.
- [ ] Editor scroll/render screen-RAM tests.  `ed_scroll_down` and
  `ed_render_line` are `.proc`-scoped (not in .lbl); test path is
  through `ed_handle_key` with cursor keys, which needs full editor
  state.  Deferred until `enter_editor` can be called via C64Emu.
- [ ] Retire `test_editor.py` mirror tests once ASM-level coverage
  is complete.
- [ ] README cross-reference tests: parse command tables in
  `README.md`, verify each command key has a handler symbol in the
  `.lbl` file.  See DDD Maintenance item 8.

## Planned

Defined scope, needs work.

### REPL

- [ ] `.` without args: behave like `d` (disassemble one instruction).
- [ ] `/` command: search for byte pattern in memory.
- [ ] `f` command: fill memory range with byte.
- [ ] `>` command: transfer/copy memory block.
- [ ] `=` command: define/query symbols from REPL.
- [ ] `r` command: uppercase set flags (`NV-BDIZC` vs `nv-bdizc`).
- [ ] `m` address argument: accept expression (`m screen+40`).
  Currently plain 4-digit hex only.
- [ ] New `S` command for scratching files. Requires confirmation.
- [ ] Disk command channel: unified under `$` (`$ s:file`, `$9`, etc.).
- [ ] Floppy status consistency: `$` prints status inline (always
  shows), `l`/`s` use `floppy_status` via `disk_done`.  Verify
  both paths produce identical output on stock KERNAL.
- [ ] `l` command PRG mode: report actual load address in stats
  line.  Currently shows `cur_addr` which may be wrong when the
  PRG loads at its own header address (addr=0 path).
- [ ] PRG range display: unify format to `AAAA-EEEE  NNNb` (range
  first, size second).  Currently `l` PRG stats prints `NNNb AAAA-EEEE`
  (size first).  Shared `print_prg_range` should use the same
  order as the assembler `; org` lines and the splash screen.
- [ ] `e` command: open editor at decimal line number (`e 42`).
  Centers the target line on screen as much as possible.  Ties
  into assembler error line numbers — assemble, see error at
  line 42, type `e 42` to jump straight there.
- [ ] `l`/`s` log line: always show actual file type suffix (`,s`
  or `,p`) in the `; load/save "name"...` output, even when the
  user omitted it.  The user should see what CBM DOS mode is used.
- [ ] Refactor internal default filename to a global project name
  without file type extension (e.g. `"test"`).  Actual filenames
  `"test,s"` and `"test,p"` are derived on demand.  The project
  name is set by source loads and saves only.  `l`/`s` without a
  string argument derive from the project name; error if none set.
  Replaces `cur_filename` (which stores the raw name with suffix).
- [ ] Investigate more shared logic for `l`/`s` argument parsing
  and filename handling.  `parse_ls_args`, `print_op_name`, and
  `print_prg_range` are a start — look for further dedup in the
  SEQ/PRG branches, error paths, and stats display.

### Help

- [ ] In-app help system.  Help text lives in KDATA (under
  KERNAL ROM, $F100 area), not RODATA — must not bloat the
  relocatable runtime.  Minimal CODE overhead: a small dispatcher
  that pages through KDATA strings.  Candidates: one-screen
  REPL command cheat sheet, editor key summary, assembler
  syntax quick ref.  Paging output (see below) would pair
  naturally.

### Output

- [ ] Paging for commands that produce more than ~23 lines of
  output (`d`, `m`, `$`, assembler messages).  Pause with
  "more" prompt, any key continues, RUN/STOP aborts.  The
  `out_log` output wrappers already funnel all command output
  through a single path — hooking a line counter there should
  be straightforward.

### Assembler

- [x] `.bas` directive: emit a BASIC SYS stub.  (Phase 12, done)
  Single BASIC line: `.bas` → `0 SYS NNNNN`.
  `.bas "TEXT"` → `0 SYS NNNNN:REM TEXT`.
  Always 5 decimal digits (260 B).  2799 tests.
- [ ] Assembler error display: show source line number + context.
- [x] Per-segment assembly summary — bug fixes + streaming design.
  Fixed bugs (pass-0 output, stale asm_pc, asm_org clobber,
  expr_val clobber, filename `,s`→`,p`).  Streaming segment lines
  during pass 1, `; ok` + save command after.  +70 B, 6 tests.
- [ ] Assembly `; ok` line: show symbol count (`; ok  NNN syms`).
  Needs `sym_count` (2B BSS) in symtab.s, incremented by `sym_define`,
  but only if the sysmbol didn't exist before.

### Editor

- [ ] Handle files > gap buffer capacity (show error, don't crash).
- [ ] Gap buffer floor above directory load area: if `list_directory`
  stays LOAD-based (loads to $0801, max ~5.1 KB), set gap buffer
  bottom to $0801+$1400=$1C01 so `$` can never clobber source.
  Currently BUF_FLOOR is computed dynamically by `compute_layout.py`
  — would need a minimum floor of $1C01.
- [ ] Gap buffer compaction: `buf_base` only grows down (via
  `gb_ensure_room`), never shrinks.  `ed_init`/`n` should reset
  `buf_base` to BUF_END.  Line deletion could trigger compaction
  but consider the trade-off (O(n) vs immediate undo).
- [ ] Page up/down with shift+cursor or F-keys.
- [ ] Search (ctrl+f equivalent via F-key).
- [ ] Goto line number (see `e` command)
- [ ] `$A0` and `$09` should be both be interpreted as TAB, both from
  keyboard input, and when handled in source code.

### Size optimization

- [ ] Table-drive `cmd_info`: replace procedural line-by-line
  memory map display with a data table + loop (~50-80 B saving).
- [ ] PRG/SEQ save dedup: `cmd_write` and `cmd_load` have shared
  patterns in filename parsing and stats display (~30-50 B).
- [ ] `exec_line` handler code sharing: inline `@h_*` handlers
  share common tail code (out_close, nl_clear, error paths).
  Factor into shared exit points.
- [ ] Disassembler `format_operand`: investigate table-driven
  formatting (packed format byte per mode, like Woz's Apple II
  disassembler) instead of procedural per-mode branches.
  Currently 220 B, could save ~80-100 B.
- [ ] Disassembler opcode table: investigate replacing the
  `aaabbbcc` bit-slice decoder with a compact 256-byte opcode
  lookup table.  Trades CODE (~350 B decode_cc00_mem alone)
  for RODATA (256 B).  Changes the architecture fundamentally.

### Architecture

- [x] Relocating startup: done (Roadmap R2, Session 10).

- [x] **PETSCII pipeline unification + expr_eval in line assembler.**
  Phase-level work (~2-3 sessions).  Estimated savings: ~474 B
  CODE + 80 B BSS.  Eliminates the VICII/PETSCII encoding split,
  the `_insn_buf` round-trip, and the duplicate hex parser.  Gives
  the `.` command full expression support (labels, arithmetic) for
  free.  Four steps:

  **Step 1 — Hash encoding: resolved, no work needed.** (Phase 12)
  AND #$1F normalization in `_asm_rd_upper` maps PETSCII
  uppercase ($41–$5A), PETSCII lowercase ($61–$7A), and VICII
  screen codes ($01–$1A) identically to 1–26.  All hash tables,
  fingerprint tables, and T arrays are encoding-agnostic.

  **Step 2 — Switch assembler pipeline to PETSCII + rename.** (Phase 12, done)
  Merged asm_bridge.s into asm_line.s (KERNAL banking, error
  recovery, SP save/restore).  Deleted PETSCII→VICII conversion
  loop.  au_mode.s operates on PETSCII: SC_* constants updated
  (A=$41, X=$58, Y=$59), hex ranges ($41–$46 for A–F).
  Renamed: `al_` → `asm_`, `au_` → `asm_`/`mode_` across all
  source, test, stub, and doc files.  2788 tests pass.

  **Step 3 — Replace mode_parse hex parser with expr_eval.** (Phase 12, done)
  Removed `_au_rd_nib`, `_au_rd_byte`, `_au_is_hex` (-73 B).
  mode_parse calls `_au_read_val` → `expr_eval_nb` (no-banking
  variant).  Operands now accept `$hex`, `%binary`, decimal,
  labels, `*`, and arithmetic.  Fixed `hex_nybble` in expr.s
  to accept uppercase A-F (`ora #$20` case fold; numeric constants
  for portability across ca65 `-t c64` and plain `--cpu 6502`).
  Test framework: asm_core bundle replaces per-module test binaries.
  Pass flag deferred to Step 4.  2797 tests pass.

  **Step 4 — Unify source assembler with line assembler.** (Phase 12, done)
  asm_src.s passes expanded source text directly to asm_line instead
  of pre-evaluating expressions and reconstructing hex.  Removed:
  hex_tab (16 B RODATA), mode detection (#/( flags), expression
  evaluation, hex formatting, suffix copying (~197 B total).
  Local label expansion (.name → scope.name) stays in asm_src.
  Forward-reference handling: pass flag (asm_pass) in _au_read_val
  substitutes asm_pc+2 on pass 0 when symbols are undefined.
  DEFAULT_CPU moved from asm_line.s to main.s init.
  ACC detection in mode_parse hardened: bare 'A' only if followed
  by end/whitespace (not identifier chars like label names).
  2797 tests pass.
- [ ] BSS optimization: overlap `_load_line`/`_load_vcol` with
  `ws_buf` (saves 3 B).
- [ ] BSS optimization: collapse `disk_seq_bytes`/`disk_seq_lines`
  with `ed_save_bytes`/`ed_save_lines` (saves 4 B).
- [ ] BSS optimization: overlap `rp_next_lo`/`rp_next_hi` with
  `rp_hexbuf` + `@new_col` (saves 3-4 B).
- [ ] Test framework: migrate dasm, expr, repl test binaries to bundle
  pattern or C64Emu integration tests.  Eliminates per-module stubs.
  See testing.md § Test bundle architecture.
- [x] Central `zp.s` owning the entire zero-page layout.  (Phase 12, done)
  All 85 ZP bytes defined in `src/zp.s` with `.exportzp`.  13 modules
  migrated from local `.segment "ZEROPAGE"` to `.importzp`.  `asm_vars.s`
  deleted (role absorbed by zp.s).  All test stubs and configs updated
  to link zp.s.  Pure refactor: 0 bytes size change, 2797 tests pass.
- [ ] DDD template drift: 10 of 16 module docs have `**Depends on:**`
  before a `### Memory` subsection inside Interface, violating the
  template rule that it must be last.  Move Memory subsections to
  Design or restructure Interface.
- [ ] Missing module docs: `src/mem.s` and `src/loader.s` have no
  `doc/modules/*.md`.  `meminfo.md` is a tombstone, not a mem.s doc.
- [ ] debugger.md: all symbol names use `_` prefix (`_bp_table`,
  `_dbg_running`, etc.) but actual exports have no prefix.  Rename
  throughout the document.
- [ ] README: missing `.bas` directive in assembler syntax table
  (added in Phase 12).
- [ ] README: `a` command description says "advances past assembled
  code" — incorrect, sets cur_addr to `main` label if defined.
- [ ] README + editor.md: "gap buffer grows down from $D000" — stale,
  should be `__CODE_RUN__` (CSE runtime start, ~$7D00).
- [ ] memory_design.md Design Principle 5: "source text grows down
  from $D000" — stale, should say "from the CSE runtime start."
- [ ] Global release version: single `VERSION` definition (currently
  Makefile `VERSION ?= 0.1`) that flows to D64 disk name, PRG
  filenames, splash screen string, and documentation.  Current
  version: v0.1a.  The D64 disk label, `$` listing, and any
  release artifacts must show the version.

## Roadmap

Long-term milestones in dependency order.

### R1 — Compile-time CPU gating (done)

All CPU-specific code gated with `.ifdef`/`.ifndef` instead of
runtime checks.

### R2 — Relocating startup (done)

CSE runtime relocated to high memory (floating start, page-aligned,
ending at $CFFF).  Discardable loader at $080D copies CODE+RODATA
at boot.  Two-pass link auto-computes runtime start address.
Workspace at $0800, ~30 KB free.  Exomizer SFX compression for
D64 distribution (~38% smaller).

### R3 — Universal C64/C128 binary

Single PRG runs on both machines.  Machine differences isolated to
three leaf functions (banking, NMI trampoline, keyboard).

### R4 — 80-column VDC mode (C128 only)

Self-contained VDC display driver, same interface as VIC-II routines.

### R5 — Cartridge ROM (CRT)

Build target for at least one CRT layout.  Candidates: Ocean Type 1
(simple banked ROM, wide emulator support) or EasyFlash (2×64 banks,
writable, real-hardware friendly).  Dual linker configs — one for
PRG, one for CRT.  Instant boot, no loader needed.  R2 (relocating
startup) provides the foundation: CODE+RODATA already position-
independent relative to their link address.

### R6 — Port C to asm (done)

All C ported to assembly.  cc65 C compiler eliminated.

### R7 — MEGA65 native support (stretch goal)

Native MEGA65 platform target, separate from C64-compatible mode.
The MEGA65 is a much more capable machine (32-bit address space,
relocated ZP internals in native mode, VIC-IV) requiring bigger
adaptations than a compatibility shim.  Alongside C128 native
(R3/R4), this would be a distinct platform target with its own
screen driver and memory model.  Far-future — depends on R3.

## Ideas

Exploratory, not yet scoped.

### Keyboard & input

- [ ] KERNAL keyboard CTRL combos: explore what key combinations
  the default KERNAL keyboard I/O delivers.  CTRL+key produces
  PETSCII control codes ($01–$1F) — identify which are usable
  without conflicting with KERNAL screen editor behaviour.
- [ ] SHIFT+CLR/HOME in REPL: clear screen.  C=+CLR/HOME: clear
  from cursor to end of screen.  Both use KERNAL screen editor
  codes (SHIFT+CLR = $93, CLR/HOME = $13).
- [ ] F-key bindings: assign useful functions to F1–F8 in both
  REPL and editor.  REPL candidates: help, repeat last command,
  toggle hex/dec, disassemble at PC.  Editor candidates: save,
  assemble, goto line, search.
- [x] Revise RUN/STOP+RESTORE and NMI handling.  (Phase 14, done)
  Permanent NMI dispatcher (`cse_nmi_handler`) at $0318.
  NMI-in-REPL → `cse_warm_screen` (clean screen recovery).
  Internal BRK → `cse_warm_start` (idempotent hard recovery).
  Warm-start re-entry guard prevents infinite BRK loops.
  NMI trampoline no longer corrupts $01.

### Features

- [ ] PRG load: auto-detect load address from PRG header.
- [ ] `$` command: filter directory listing by filename glob.
- [ ] `d` command: show ASCII alongside disassembly (like `m`).
- [ ] `.` command: show help when mnemonic given without operand.
- [ ] Color command `C`: show color preview swatches.
- [ ] Disk I/O: timeout handling for unresponsive drives.
- [x] NMI during `j` user code.  (Phase 14, done)
  `cse_nmi_handler` dispatches on `dbg_running` — user-code
  NMI breaks into debugger immediately via `dbg_nmi_break`.
- [ ] REU support for large source files.
- [ ] Macro support: .macro/.endmacro.
- [ ] Conditional assembly: .if/.else/.endif.
- [ ] Include files: .inc.
- [ ] Detect PAL/NTSC at startup.
- [ ] MEGA65 Open-KERNAL compatibility (C64-compatible mode):
  `$` works (LOAD-based).  Floppy status empty (shows `; `)
  — blocked on upstream IEC channel-I/O fixes
  (MEGA65/open-roms#116, #117).  Channel-based dir code
  preserved in `1348247` for when fixes land.  All other
  features work.  Native mode is roadmap R7.
- [ ] DDD back-reference tracking: link source files to their
  documentation via a machine-readable index.  DDD Maintenance
  verifies code changes trigger doc updates for all covering
  documents.
